/*
 3 Ronnieâ€™s Ribbons
Input File: RonniesIn.txt
Ronnie has collected pieces of red ribbons of various lengths. When she needs a length of ribbon
that she does not have, she locates two pieces of ribbon from her collection whose combined
length is the length she needs. Then she tapes them together end-to-end (with no overlap).
Your task is to determine how many ribbons of a given length she could produce from her
collection of ribbon pieces, given the length of ribbon she needs and the length of each piece of
ribbon in the collection.
Inputs:
The first line of input will be the number of ribbon piece collections to consider, followed by two
lines of input per collection. The first of these two lines contains two integers that represent the
length of ribbon Ronnie needs follow by the number of ribbon pieces, n, in the collection. The
second line will contain n integers that represent the length of each of the ribbon pieces in the
collection. The inputs will be separated by a space.
Outputs
There will be one output per ribbon collection that represents the number of ribbons of the given
length she could produce from the collection.
