/*
 2 Seven Times Tables
Input File: SevenTimesIn.txt
Bob has been asked to identify which numbers in a given sequence of numbers, each of which
are less than one billion, are members of the seven times table. Although he memorized the table
in grammar school: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, â€¦ he was not required to go past 70. Therefore, he has
asked you to write a program to identify the members of the seven times table that appear in the
sequence of numbers he will be given.
Inputs:
The first line of input will contain an integer that is the number of sequences Bob will be asked
to examine. This will be followed by one line of input per sequence that contains integers, each
separated by a space. The first integer on a line will be a count of the numbers in the sequence,
and the remaining integers on the line will be the numbers that make up the sequence.

Outputs
There will be one line of output per sequence that contains the numbers in the sequence that are
part of the seven times table.
Sample Input
2
6 32 70 62 147 626326 10326722
4 41132 61334 712349 98765436
Sample output
70 147 10326722
41132 61334 98765436
