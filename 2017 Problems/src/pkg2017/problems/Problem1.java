airplane she is on has just announced the hours and minutes remaining in the flight, and she
would like to begin counting down the seconds until touchdown. Your task is to convert the
remaining hours and minutes of flight time to seconds, so that she can begin her countdown.
Inputs:

the number of hours, followed by the number of minutes, until the airplane lands.

Outputs
There will be one integer output: the number of seconds remaining in Nadiaâ€™s flight, annotated as
shown below.
Sample Input
1 10
Sample output
